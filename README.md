# Musicless-Piano-Game

Project Description: Musicless Piano Game
This game was built as my AP CSP final project to demostrate skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It includes user interaction and real-time score tracking.

How to Use the Website
- Hit the **"Start Game"** button to begin
- Click ONLY the black tiles before they disappear off the screen
- Every correct click earns +1 point
- Clicking a white tile or missing a black one ends the game

File Structure
- index.html: Main webpage where the game runs
- instructions.html: Secondary linked page that explains how to play the game
- styles.css: Visual styling --> layout, colors, font, etc.
- script.js: Handles game LOGIC --> Score, moving tiles, game start + ending, etc.
